When in doubt, the output should match the `JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)` function output. `data` being the contents of the json file.

## File Names

All filenames should be lower-case. Spaces should be replaced by dashes ("-").

## Movies

Each movie should be added to its own year folder and follow the "File Names" rule (above).
If the year is not present add it. 

### Storyline / Description

### Director / Writer / Actors

The keys are "director" or "writer" or "actors". Note that only the "actors" keys is plural.
